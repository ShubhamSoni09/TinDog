# TinDog
A responsive UI clone of tinder, but the catch is that it is for dogs!

It is a single page website which provides details of the application to the end user like the desscription of the website, from where we can download the application, a section that displays the feedback from the clients and different plans and subscriptions.

The main framework used in building the TinDog website is Bootstrap and its components like Carousel, Card, Buttons, Navbar etc. It also used HTML5, CSS3, Google Fonts and Font Awesome.
